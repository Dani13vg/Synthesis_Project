# App

This directory contains a python file using tkinter to create the interface of the project. Just running the file the interface will be opened. It contains two main buttons, one to plot some information about the data, and also with a searcher for specific workers. And the second button opens several scrollable bars to select the different input variables for our model to predict the most suitable translator.
